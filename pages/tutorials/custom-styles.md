Tangram draws map features using its [built-in _draw styles_](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/Styles-Overview/): `polygons`, `lines`, `points`, `text`, and `raster`. Using the `styles` element, you can customize the behavior of these draw styles, either by using the many built-in customization features, or by making your own effects from scratch using [shaders](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/shaders/).

This tutorial will explore three things you can make with custom styles: dashed lines, transparent polygons, and shader effects.

Note: in the examples in this tutorial, we are relying on the [layer name shortcut](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/Filters-Overview/#layer-name-shortcut) and [style name shortcut](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/Styles-Overview/#using-styles).

## Dashed Lines

Let's use one of the built-in style customization options, [`dash`](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/styles#dash), to draw some dashed lines.

(To follow along, use [Tangram Play](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play), a custom [Tangram setup](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/Tangram-Setup), or follow the links to the examples throughout this tutorial.)

Add a datasource to your map with a [`sources`](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/sources) entry, then add some lines to your map - in our example, we'll start with road features from the [Mapzen Vector Tile Service](https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles/).

```yaml
sources:
    mapzen:
        type: TopoJSON
        url: https://tile.mapzen.com/mapzen/vector/v1/all/{z}/{x}/{y}.topojson

layers:
    roads:
        data: { source: mapzen }
        draw:
            lines:
                order: 1
                width: 5px
                color: gray
```
![simple road map](https://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/tutorials/custom/custom1.jpg)
[( Open in Play ▶ )](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/tutorials/custom/custom1.yaml#16.50417/40.78070/-73.96085)

Now make a custom _draw style_ called "_dashes" – this name could be anything, and the leading underscore isn't required, but it's a handy way to remember which things we named ourselves.

Give the new style a `base` draw style of "lines", then add a `dash` parameter. The `dash` parameter takes an array, which sets the length of the dashes and gaps.

```yaml
styles:
    _dashes:
        base: lines
        dash: [1, 1]
```

The values of the `dash` parameter are relative to the `width` of the line – a value of `2` produces a dash or gap twice as long as the line's width, `.5` is half the line's width, and `1` produces a square.

So far our new style isn't used anywhere, so no dashes will be seen. To fix this, rename the _draw group_ of the "roads" layer from `lines` to `_dashes`, and the roads will be drawn in the custom style.

```yaml
sources:
    mapzen:
        type: TopoJSON
        url: https://tile.mapzen.com/mapzen/vector/v1/all/{z}/{x}/{y}.topojson

styles:
    _dashes:
        base: lines
        dash: [1, 1]

layers:
    roads:
        data: { source: mapzen }
        draw:
            _dashes:
                order: 1
                width: 5px
                color: gray
```
![dashed lines](https://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/tutorials/custom/custom3.jpg)

By default, the `dash` style has a transparent background, but you can give the background a solid color using the `dash_background_color` option:

```yaml
styles:
    _dashes:
        base: lines
        dash: [1, 1]
        dash_background_color: pink
```

You can also apply an `outline`:

```yaml
layers:
    roads:
        data: { source: mapzen }
        draw:
            _dashes:
                order: 1
                width: 5px
                color: gray
                outline:
                    color: pink
                    width: 1px
```

## Transparency with Blend Modes

Now let's add transparency to a polygons layer, using another custom styling option, [`blend`](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/styles/#blend).

The blend modes are not true 3D transparency, but function like the blend modes in Photoshop, which work by compositing layered pixels together.

Start with a buildings data layer drawn with a basic `polygons` style:

```yaml
sources:
    mapzen:
        type: TopoJSON
        url: https://tile.mapzen.com/mapzen/vector/v1/all/{z}/{x}/{y}.topojson

layers:
    buildings:
        data: { source: mapzen }
        draw:
            polygons:
                order: 1
                color: [.7, .7, .7]
                extrude: true
```
![basic buildings map](https://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/tutorials/custom/custom6.jpg)
[( Open in Play ▶ )](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/tutorials/custom/custom6.yaml#17/40.76442/-73.98058)

Add a new style based on the `polygons` style – ours is named "\_transparent". Then, add a `blend` mode of `overlay`, and set the buildings _draw style_ to match the name of the custom style.

There's one more step which is easy to overlook: right now the building layer's color value is a solid gray, `[.7, .7, .7]`. The three values in that array are the Red, Green, and Blue channels. But there's another possible channel for Alpha, which controls transparency, and if you don't specify it, it defaults to `1`, which is opaque.

The `blend` modes respect alpha, so let's add an alpha value of `.5`, which is 50% opacity, and we will achieve transparency at last:

```yaml
sources:
    mapzen:
        type: TopoJSON
        url: https://tile.mapzen.com/mapzen/vector/v1/all/{z}/{x}/{y}.topojson

styles:
    _transparent:
        base: polygons
        blend: overlay

layers:
    buildings:
        data: { source: mapzen }
        draw:
            _transparent:
                order: 1
                color: [.7, .7, .7, .5]
                extrude: true
```
![transparent buildings](https://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/tutorials/custom/custom9.jpg)

(Check out Tangram's [color documentation](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/draw/#color) to see how color values may be specified.)

## Shader Effects

Custom shaders are also achieved through custom `styles`, using the [`shaders`](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/shaders/#shaders) block. Starting with the buildings layer again, add a new entry to the `styles` block named "\_custom", and change the _draw style_ of the buildings layer to match.

Then, add a `shaders` block to the style, with a `blocks` block and a `color` block inside that. This `color` block will hold the shader code, which is written in GLSL. To start off (and to tell it's working) set the output color to something like `vec3(1, 0, 1)` which is GLSL's way of specifying the RGB values for magenta:

```yaml
sources:
    mapzen:
        type: TopoJSON
        url: https://tile.mapzen.com/mapzen/vector/v1/all/{z}/{x}/{y}.topojson

styles:
    _custom:
        base: polygons
        shaders:
            blocks:
                color: |
                    color.rgb = vec3(1, 0, 1);

layers:
    buildings:
        data: { source: mapzen }
        draw:
            _custom:
                order: 1
                extrude: true
```
![magenta buildings](https://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/tutorials/custom/custom11.jpg)
[( Open in Play ▶ )](https://mapzen.com/tangram/play/?scene=https://tangrams.github.io/tangram-docs/tutorials/custom/custom11.yaml&lines=12#17.00000/40.76442/-73.98060)

(You'll notice shading on the sides of buildings – this is because of the default light settings. Read more about these in our [lighting documentation](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/lights/#lights).)

Now you can write your own shader functions to control the color of the buildings directly. You can also use built-in variables if you wish to control the color with properties of the geometry or scene. Let's get the `worldPosition()` of each vertex and reference that in the shader's `color` block, so the buildings will be colored based on z-value (aka height):

```yaml
styles:
    _custom:
        base: polygons
        shaders:
            blocks:
                color: |
                    color.rgb *= vec3(worldPosition().z) / 100.;
```

And when `animated: true` is added to the style, you can make effects based on the `u_time` internal variable:

```yaml
styles:
    _custom:
        base: polygons
        animated: true
        shaders:
            blocks:
                color: |
                    color.rgb *= worldPosition().zzz / 100.;
                    color *= sin(u_time);
```

Experiment with different `color` values to see the way the shader's `color` and the draw layer's `color` interact.
